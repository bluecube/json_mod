JSON mod

This is a parser of a language based on JSON intended for configuration files.

The language is a strict superset of JSON, adding comments ( # Comment, // Comment, or /* Comment */ ), unquoted strings (must match regex [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*) and allowing extra comma after the last item of a list or dictionary.

The parser is written in pure python 3, and is expected to be fairly slow. It provides the same load(file_object) and loads(string) interface as standard json library, but allowing to use any iterable returning characters for the loads variant.  If the boolean parameter enable_extensions is set to False, the parser will accept only pure JSON.
